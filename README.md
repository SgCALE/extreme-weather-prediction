## **Overview**

Welcome to our weather prediction web app! This repo contains the code for the web app documentation.

The web app demonstrates the capabilities of using a ConvLSTM2D model to predict extreme weather events across Singapore. Through this web app, we hope to showcase the potential of using Deep Neural Networks to capture spatiotemporal dependencies within meteorological datasets to predict the onset of extreme weather events. The accuracy of the deployed models in this web app has much room for improvement. However, we hope that by sharing our findings and potential areas for future research, we can contribute to developing more reliable forecasting systems for Singapore.
